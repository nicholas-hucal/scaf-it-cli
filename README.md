## Examples

### 1. Default Behavior

```bash

```

Scaffolds a React component named `MyComponent` in `src/components` with:

- `MyComponent.jsx`
- `MyComponent.scss`
- `index.js`

---

### 2. Custom Location

You can add a custom location by providing a path local to the project of your choosing.

```bash
scaf-it MyComponent src/custom/path
```

Scaffolds `MyComponent` in `src/custom/path` in the CWD.

---

### 3. Skip `index.js`

```bash
scaf-it MyComponent --no-index
```

Scaffolds the component without generating an `index.js` file.

---

### 4. Use CSS for Styling

```bash
scaf-it MyComponent --css
```

Scaffolds the component with `MyComponent.css` instead of `MyComponent.scss`.

---

### 5. Combine Options

```bash
scaf-it MyComponent src/custom/path --no-index --css
```

Scaffolds the component in `src/custom/path` without `index.js` and uses `CSS` for styling.

## Output Example

When you scaffold a component, the following structure is generated:

```plaintext
src/components/MyComponent/
â”œâ”€â”€ MyComponent.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ MyComponent.scss (or .css)
â””â”€â”€ index.js (optional)
